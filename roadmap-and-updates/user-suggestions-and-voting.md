# User Suggestions & Voting

***

We believe the best platforms are built with the community, not just for it. That’s why we’ve opened a User Feedback Portal for:

*
  \
  • Suggesting new features
  \
  • Voting on upcoming product ideas
  \
  • Reporting bugs or usability issues
  \
  • Proposing integrations, exchanges, and token pairs
  \
  • Requesting course topics or trading strategies

How It Works:

*
  \
  • Submit your suggestion via your dashboard
  \
  • View the live community voting board
  \
  • Top-voted ideas are reviewed monthly by our product team
  \
  • Features with strong community support are prioritized for development

VIP users receive exclusive access to private roadmap calls and beta testing sessions.
