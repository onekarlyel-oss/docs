Introduction

Zionix Global is committed to transparency, education, and user empowerment. However, all users, investors, and subscribers must fully understand and accept the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, automated trading systems, and decentralized finance (DeFi). This Risk Warning outlines the potential risks you may face when using our services, including but not limited to our AI trading bots, trading signals, NFT-based licenses, and staking or revenue-sharing features.

By engaging with Zionix Global in any capacity, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Risk Warning in its entirety.

1. General Trading Risks

1.1 Volatility

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically within short periods due to market news, regulatory changes, liquidity shifts, or macroeconomic factors. These fluctuations can result in substantial profits or significant losses.

1.2 Market Risk

Trading, whether manual or automated, involves exposure to market risk. Zionix Global’s bots may perform sub-optimally during unexpected market events, extreme volatility, or during systemic events such as exchange outages, smart contract exploits, or rapid sell-offs.

2. Automated Trading Bot Risks

2.1 No Guarantee of Profit

Although our bots are designed with advanced AI algorithms and backtested strategies, past performance does not guarantee future results. Daily revenue percentages advertised (e.g., up 1%–1.5%) are targets based on ideal conditions, not promises or fixed returns.

2.2 System Errors or Interruptions

Bots rely on complex infrastructures, including servers, APIs, third-party exchanges, and blockchain networks. Technical malfunctions, connectivity failures, data feed issues, or third-party platform changes can interrupt bot performance.

2.3 Overfitting and Strategy Degradation

AI models may suffer from “overfitting”—optimizing performance on historical data while underperforming in live markets. Market conditions evolve, and previously successful strategies may lose effectiveness over time.

3.

NFT Licensing and Marketplace Risk

3.1 Digital Ownership Uncertainty

While NFTs represent digital ownership of bot licenses, their value is speculative and may fluctuate based on market demand, bot performance, and platform popularity. Zionix Global makes no guarantees regarding the resale value or liquidity of any NFT license.

3.2 Marketplace Limitations

The Zionix Global Marketplace is under development. Until launched, NFT transfers or resales may be limited or not possible. Additionally, legal, regulatory, or technical restrictions may affect the future functionality of these assets.

4. Capital Deposit and Lock Risk

4.1 Lock Periods

Deposited capital is subject to a mandatory 180-day lock period, during which the principal cannot be withdrawn. Early withdrawal requests incur a 30% penalty fee. Users must plan finances accordingly and not deposit funds they cannot afford to lock for this duration.

4.2 Liquidity Risk

In the event of high-volume withdrawal requests or market stress, processing delays may occur. Zionix Global reserves the right to extend withdrawal times if required by network congestion, liquidity constraints, or system maintenance.

5. Regulatory and Legal Risks

5.1 Regulatory Uncertainty

Cryptocurrency and DeFi platforms operate in an evolving legal landscape. Laws, regulations, or government actions may restrict or prohibit services offered by Zionix Global in certain jurisdictions. Users are responsible for complying with local laws.

5.2 Tax Implications

Earnings from crypto trading and staking may be taxable. Zionix Global does not provide tax advice. Users are solely responsible for tracking their gains/losses and fulfilling their reporting obligations under local tax laws.

6. Counterparty and Platform Risks

6.1 Third-Party Dependencies

Zionix Global’s trading bots interact with decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and external APIs. We do not control these third-party entities, and disruptions or failures on their end may affect user performance or accessibility.

6.2 Custody and Non-Custodial Risks

Zionix Global does not provide custodial services. Users are responsible for securing their private keys, wallet credentials, and access tokens. Lost credentials may result in permanent loss of access to assets or accounts.

7. User Responsibility and Risk Management

7.1 Not Financial Advice

All educational material, trading signals, and strategy insights provided by Zionix Global are for informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial, investment, or legal advice.

7.2 Risk of Loss

All trading and investment decisions are made at your own risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Users are encouraged to diversify their investment strategies and perform independent research before engaging in trading activities.

7.3 Due Diligence Required

Before purchasing any license, depositing funds, or activating bots, users must read the full Zionix Global Terms of Use, User Agreement, and this Risk Warning. Failure to do so does not exempt users from the associated risks.
