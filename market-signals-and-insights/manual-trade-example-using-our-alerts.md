# Manual Trade Example Using Our Alerts

***

Let’s walk through a sample manual trade using a Zionix signal:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
You receive a signal to go long on BTC/USDT with the following details:

• Entry: 28,000 – 28,200
\
• TP1: 28,600 | TP2: 29,000
\
• Stop Loss: 27,750
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
You open your preferred crypto exchange, set a limit buy within the entry zone, and configure:

• Take-Profit orders at each TP level
\
• Stop-loss at the recommended threshold
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
You let the trade execute as the market moves. Based on real-time price action, you may:

• Manually adjust SL to break even
\
• Take partial profit at TP1 or TP2
\
• Ride the move until TP3 is reached



Each signal allows for risk-adjusted decision-making, tailored to your comfort level.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
